Further, changes in the abundance and composition of fish assemblages may have consequences for ecosystem function and fisheries productivity. Even if fisheries species are generally resilient to habitat degradation, harvesting of larger fishes may threaten ecosystem functions that are critical to coral reef resilience.

abstract = {Fishes contribute substantially to energy and nutrient fluxes in reef ecosystems, but quantifying these roles is challenging. Here, we do so by synthesising a large compilation of fish metabolic-rate data with a comprehensive database on reef-fish community abundance and biomass. Individual-level analyses support predictions of Metabolic Theory after accounting for significant family-level variation, and indicate that some tropical reef fishes may already be experiencing thermal regimes at or near their temperature optima. Community-level analyses indicate that total estimated respiratory fluxes of reef-fish communities increase on average {\~{}}2-fold from 22 to 28 °C. Comparisons of estimated fluxes among trophic groups highlight striking differences in resource use by communities in different regions, perhaps partly reflecting distinct evolutionary histories, and support the hypothesis that piscivores receive substantial energy subsidies from outside reefs. Our study demonstrates one approach to synthesising individual- and community-level data to establish broad-scale trends in contributions of biota to ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {Oxygen consumption rate was measured as a function of swimming velocity for the vertically migrating euphausiid Euphausia pacifica at two temperatures (8° and 12°C) and pressures (1 and 40 atm) typical of its bathymetric distribution. Increased swimming speed (x; mh-1) required increased oxygen consumption (y; $\mu$l O2 mg dry weight-1 h-1), described by the equation y = 0.012x + 0.64 at 8°C, and by y = 0.020x + 0.85 at 12° C. The current concept of low swimming costs of zooplankton, based on determinations of dead drag in copepods, is contradicted by our measurements. Temperature had a more profound effect on metabolism at higher swimming speeds (112 m h-1; Q10=2.8) than on standard metabolism (O m h-1; Q10=2.0), indicating that activity is more costly at higher temperatures. Pressure caused a small but significant (P{\textgreater}0.05) rise in the relationship of respiratory rate to swimming speed at both temperatures. The energy cost of vertical migration for E. pacifica was estimated by applying our data on oxygen consumption vs swimming speed to published observations on sonic scattering layer movement and the day-night distribution pattern of this species. Results indicate that the cost of a diel migration of 254 m, through a temperature change of 4 °C (8° to 12° C), would cancel any energetic benefit gained by time spent at the lower temperature typical of daytime depth. The act of vertical migration is energetically expensive; its cost should be thoroughly considered in attempts to describe the energetics of vertically migrating species. {\textcopyright} 1983 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Central to our understanding of locomotion in fishes are the performance implications of using different modes of swimming. Employing a unique combination of laboratory performance trials and field observations of swimming speed, this study investigated the comparative performance of pectoral and body-caudal fin swimming within an entire assemblage of coral reef fishes (117 species 10 families). Field observations of swimming behaviour identified three primary modes: labriform (pectoral 70 spp.), subcarangiform (body-caudal 29 spp.) and chaetodontiform (augmented body-caudal 18 spp.). While representative taxa from all three modes were capable of speeds exceeding 50 cm s−1 during laboratory trials, only pectoral-swimmers maintained such high speeds under field conditions. Direct comparisons revealed that pectoral-swimming species maintained field speeds at a remarkable 70{\%} of their maximum (lab-tested) recorded speed; species using body-caudal fin propulsion maintained field speeds at around 50{\%} of maximum. These findings highlight a profound influence of swimming mode on performance, with the relative mechanical and energetic efficiency of each swimming mode being of major importance. Combining attributes of efficiency, maneuverability and speed in one mode of propulsion, pectoral swimming appears to be a particularly versatile form of locomotion, well suited to a demersal lifestyle on coral reefs.},

We found no statistically significant difference between values of activity rate obtained using the two approaches for three of the six experiments we performed. However, there was no relationship between estimates of activity rate obtained using the two approaches. Discrepancies may arise from the difficulty to meet assumptions regarding the temporal stability of the concentration of 133Cs in fish diet and of the assimilation coefficient of this tracer. When fish remain in an area where their behaviour can be well described (e.g., enclosure, habitat patches of littoral zones, coral reefs), the behavioural approach appears more robust to estimate activity rate because it depends most on a variable that is easiest to estimate (the number of movements perf...},

Activity costs were estimated by converting swimming speeds and the number of movements into swimming costs. Average swimming speed ranged from 6.7 to 12.2 cm . s(-1) across 2 h periods and varied significantly among dates and time of day. The time spent swimming by dace ranged from 616 to 17 640 s 2 h(-1). Activity costs per 2 h period ranged from 2.1 to 40.2 J 2 h(-1) and were strongly correlated to the time spent swimming. Daily activity cost estimated using the cameras averaged 128.9 J day(-1) and was equivalent to 1.7 times the standard metabolic rate. Activity cost predicted using a bioenergetic model in conjunction with independent estimates of consumption and growth rates averaged 138.8 J day(-1). This study indicated that swimming characteristics and activity costs of dace varied significantly both within and among days.

Unfortunately, however, no complete empirical dataset exists on the relationship between minimal and maximal metabolism (and thus aerobic scope) for any fish species throughout ontogeny, and thus such an association is hard to delineate. We measured standard and maximal metabolism in three marine fish species over their entire life history, and show that while aerobic scope depends greatly on body size and developmental trajectory, it is extremely small during the early life stages (factorial aerobic scope {\textless} or =1.5). Our findings strongly suggest that limited scope for aerobic activity early in life is likely to constrain physiological function and ultimately impact behaviour and possibly survival. Furthermore, our results have important implications for ecological models that incorporate metabolic scaling, and provide additional evidence against the existence of 'universal' scaling exponents.},

abstract = {1. We present a model that yields ecosystem-level predictions of the flux, storage and turnover of carbon in three important pools (autotrophs, decomposers, labile soil C) based on the constraints of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate. 2. The model predicts a 10 000-fold increase in C turnover rates moving from tree- to phytoplankton-dominated ecosystems due to the size dependence of photosynthetic rates. 3. The model predicts a 16-fold increase in rates controlled by respiration (e.g. decomposition, turnover of labile soil C and microbial biomass) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of ATP synthesis in respiratory complexes. 4. The model predicts only a fourfold increase in rates controlled by photosynthesis (e.g. net primary production, litter fall, fine root turnover) over the temperature range 0-30 degrees C due to the temperature dependence of Rubisco carboxylation in chloroplasts. 5. The difference between the temperature dependence of respiration and photosynthesis yields quantitative predictions for distinct phenomena that include acclimation of plant respiration, geographic gradients in labile C storage, and differences between the short- and long-term temperature dependence of whole-ecosystem CO2 flux. 6. These four sets of model predictions were tested using global compilations of data on C flux, storage and turnover in ecosystems. 7. Results support the hypothesis that the combined effects of body size and temperature on individual metabolic rate impose important constraints on the global C cycle. The model thus provides a synthetic, mechanistic framework for linking global biogeochemical cycles to cellular-, individual- and community-level processes. F},

This study extends previous calibration studies, explores how well tail-beat frequency transmitters fulfill their role, and presents a procedure to convert acceleration data into metabolic cost within a framework consistent with traditional fish bioenergetics models and thus facilitates comparisons of energetic costs between natural fish populations. These objectives were achieved by comparing data from lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in a laboratory setting with data from three natural populations. In the laboratory, tail-beat frequency, acceleration values, and oxygen consumption increased progressively with swimming speed. In the wild, individual swimming speeds estimated from positional telemetry were consistently underestimated by, but positively related to, transmitter-based acceleration values. The proposed rationale to estimate metabolic rate from acceleration data accounts for variation in fish mass and environmental temperature. We demonstrated how this novel method permits comparison of metabolic costs associated with the levels of activity typical of lake trout living in two different lakes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Plant diversity generally promotes biomass production, but how the shape of the response curve changes with time remains unclear. This is a critical knowledge gap because the shape of this relationship indicates the extent to which loss of the first few species will influence biomass production. Using two long-term (≥13 years) biodiversity experiments, we show that the effects of diversity on biomass productivity increased and became less saturating over time. Our analyses suggest that effects of diversity-dependent ecosystem feedbacks and interspecific complementarity accumulate over time, causing high-diversity species combinations that appeared functionally redundant during early years to become more functionally unique through time. Consequently, simplification of diverse ecosystems will likely have greater negative impacts on ecosystem functioning than has been suggested by short-term experiments.},

If variation associated with body temperature and digestive state are removed, the BMRs of eutherians, marsupials, and birds do not differ, and no significant allometric exponent heterogeneity remains between orders.

A number of other species are introduced as their activity relates to the discussion. The nocturnal species are predators, while the herbiv- orous and omnivorous fishes show predominantly diurnal feeding habits. Those species schooling in dense, relatively inactive schools inshore during the day are nocturnal feeders and the school functions in defense against diurnal predators. Members of these schools disperse to feed at night, often after moving a considerable distance offshore.},

abstract = {Ecosystem Services (ES) – the direct (e.g., food and natural medicines) and indirect (e.g., cultural diversity and aesthetic values) benefits people obtain from various ecosystems – need to be assessed to aid decision makers and concerned public in creating policies that ensure continuous flow of ES to their beneficiaries (e.g., fisheries, food, income, livelihood, and traditional way of life to fishers and consumers). However, to date, ES assessments in Philippine reefs are mostly concentrated only on fisheries and tourism or on few areas in the Philippines (e.g., Pangasinan and Bohol Marine Triangle). This study fills research gaps by assessing coral reefs across 15 regions in the Philippines by estimating the following: (1) potential reef fisheries and Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) biodiversity values using underwater surveys and literature data, (2) reef fisheries value using Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) and literature data, (3) tourism value using Department of Tourism (DOT) and literature data, and (4) Total Economic Value (TEV). The TEV of Philippine reefs' ES amounted to 4 billion US{\$}/yr or 140,000 US{\$}/km2/yr. Furthermore, in each region of the Philippines, annual TEV ranged from 100 to 800 million US{\$} with potential reef fisheries value contributing the most in the TEV, followed by reef fisheries, tourism, and WTP biodiversity values. In addition, the Visayas regions have the highest values of benefits from coral reefs. Although the Philippines is deriving millions to billions of dollars of economic benefits from coral reefs, the observed degradation and temporal decline in coastal ecosystems could lead to a decline in the potential reef fisheries value, subsequently the TEV. The Philippines need to improve accounting and managing the derived benefits from coral reefs to ensure the sustainability and continuous flow of these benefits for present and future Filipino beneficiaries.},

abstract = {Maximum (aerobic) metabolic rate (MMR) is defined here as the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (M˙O2max ) that a fish can achieve at a given temperature under any ecologically relevant circumstance. Different techniques exist for eliciting MMR of fishes, of which swim-flume respirometry (critical swimming speed tests and burst-swimming protocols) and exhaustive chases are the most common. Available data suggest that the most suitable method for eliciting MMR varies with species and ecotype, and depends on the propensity of the fish to sustain swimming for extended durations as well as its capacity to simultaneously exercise and digest food. MMR varies substantially ({\textgreater}10 fold) between species with different lifestyles (i.e. interspecific variation), and to a lesser extent ({\textless}three-fold) between individuals of the same species (i.e. intraspecific variation). MMR often changes allometrically with body size and is modulated by several environmental factors, including temperature and oxygen availability. Due to the significance of MMR in determining aerobic scope, interest in measuring this trait has spread across disciplines in attempts to predict effects of climate change on fish populations. Here, various techniques used to elicit and measure MMR in different fish species with contrasting lifestyles are outlined and the relevance of MMR to the ecology, fitness and climate change resilience of fishes is discussed.},

abstract = {This review and data analysis outline how fish biologists should most reliably estimate the minimal amount of oxygen needed by a fish to support its aerobic metabolic rate (termed standard metabolic rate; SMR). By reviewing key literature, it explains the theory, terminology and challenges underlying SMR measurements in fishes, which are almost always made using respirometry (which measures oxygen uptake, ṀO2 ). Then, the practical difficulties of measuring SMR when activity of the fish is not quantitatively evaluated are comprehensively explored using 85 examples of ṀO2 data from different fishes and one crustacean, an analysis that goes well beyond any previous attempt. The main objective was to compare eight methods to estimate SMR. The methods were: average of the lowest 10 values (low10) and average of the 10{\%} lowest ṀO2 values, after removing the five lowest ones as outliers (low10{\%}), mean of the lowest normal distribution (MLND) and quantiles that assign from 10 to 30{\%} of the data below SMR (q0{\textperiodcentered}1 , q0{\textperiodcentered}15 , q0{\textperiodcentered}2 , q0{\textperiodcentered}25 and q0{\textperiodcentered}3 ). The eight methods yielded significantly different SMR estimates, as expected. While the differences were small when the variability was low amongst the ṀO2 values, they were important ({\textgreater}20{\%}) for several cases. The degree of agreement between the methods was related to the c.v. of the observations that were classified into the lowest normal distribution, the c.v. MLND (C.V.MLND ). When this indicator was low (≤5{\textperiodcentered}4), it was advantageous to use the MLND, otherwise, one of the q0{\textperiodcentered}2 or q0{\textperiodcentered}25 should be used. The second objective was to assess if the data recorded during the initial recovery period in the respirometer should be included or excluded, and the recommendation is to exclude them. The final objective was to determine the minimal duration of experiments aiming to estimate SMR. The results show that 12 h is insufficient but 24 h is adequate. A list of basic recommendations for practitioners who use respirometry to measure SMR in fishes is provided.},

abstract = {We review the current knowledge on biodiversity in soils, its role in ecosystem processes, its importance for human purposes, and its resilience against stress and disturbance. The number of existing species is vastly higher than the number described, even in the macroscopically visible taxa, and biogeographical syntheses are largely lacking. A major effort in taxonomy and the training of a new generation of systematists is imperative. This effort has to e focussed on the groups of soil organisms that, to the best of our knowledge, play key roles in ecosystem functioning. To identify such groups, spheres of influence (SO1) of soil biota - such as the root biota, the shredders of organic matter and the soil bioturbators - are recognized that presumably control ecosystem processes, for example, through interactions with plants. Within those SO1, functional groups of soil organisms are recognized. Research questions of the highest urgency are the assignment of species to functional groups and determining the redundancy of species within functional groups. These priorities follow from the need to address the extent of any loss of functioning in soils, associated with intensive agriculture, forest disturbance, pollution of the environment, and global environmental change. The soil biota considered at present to be most at risk are species-poor functional groups among macrofaunal shredders of organic matter, bioturbators of soil, specialized bacteria like nitrifiers and nitrogen fixers, and fungiforming mycorrhizas. An experimental approach in addressing these research priorities is needed, using long-term and large-scale field experiments and modern methods of geostatistics and geographic information systems.},

abstract = {In this review I show that the '3/4-power scaling law' of metabolic rate is not universal, either within or among animal species. Significant variation in the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass is described mainly for animals, but also for unicells and plants. Much of this variation, which can be related to taxonomic, physiological, and/or environmental differences, is not adequately explained by existing theoretical models, which are also reviewed. As a result, synthetic explanatory schemes based on multiple boundary constraints and on the scaling of multiple energy-using processes are advocated. It is also stressed that a complete understanding of metabolic scaling will require the identification of both proximate (functional) and ultimate (evolutionary) causes. Four major types of intraspecific metabolic scaling with body mass are recognized [based on the power function R = aMb, where R is respiration (metabolic) rate, a is a constant, M is body mass, and b is the scaling exponent]: Type I: linear, negatively allometric (b {\textless} 1); Type II: linear, isometric (b = 1); Type III: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from isometric (b = 1), or nearly isometric, to negatively allometric (b {\textless} 1); and Type IV: nonlinear, ontogenetic shift from positively allometric (b {\textgreater} 1) to one or two later phases of negative allometry (b {\textless} 1). Ontogenetic changes in the metabolic intensity of four component processes (i.e. growth, reproduction, locomotion, and heat production) appear to be important in these different patterns of metabolic scaling. These changes may, in turn, be shaped by age (size)-specific patterns of mortality. In addition, major differences in interspecific metabolic scaling are described, especially with respect to mode of temperature regulation, body-size range, and activity level. A 'metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis' focusing on two major constraints (surface-area limits on resource/waste exchange processes and mass/volume limits on power production) can explain much, but not all of this variation. My analysis indicates that further empirical and theoretical work is needed to understand fully the physiological and ecological bases for the considerable variation in metabolic scaling that is observed both within and among species. Recommended approaches for doing this are discussed. I conclude that the scaling of metabolism is not the simple result of a physical law, but rather appears to be the more complex result of diverse adaptations evolved in the context of both physico-chemical and ecological constraints. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {The maximum aerobic metabolic rates of tunas are far above those of other fishes. In this review we attempt to define features of the cardiovascular system that may account for this extreme performance. Tuna hearts are much larger than those of most other fishes and are half the mass of these of similarly sized mammals; however, the ratio of compact to spongy myocardium is not (except for one tuna species) higher than in other active teleosts. Myocardial aerobic enzyme activity levels are not significantly elevated. The cardiac outputs of spinally blocked skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) are roughly 4 times those of other active teleosts. Ventral aortic blood pressures are the highest among all fishes (more than twice those of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, formerly Salmo gairdneri)), and appear to be due to a high resistance to blood flow in the gills, since dorsal aortic blood pressures are not exceptional. Heart rates, cardiac output, and ventilation volume are high, but gill ventilation and perfusion appear to be well matched (i.e, gill ventilation: perfusion conductance ratios of .apprxeq. 1). Blood hemoglobin concentrations of tunas are elevated, essentially identical with those of humans and twice those seen in other fishes. Because their blood oxygen carrying capacity is high and because skipjack and yellowfin tunas appear to be able to increase the minimum observed arterial to venous oxygen content differences approximately 3 times, we predict that they need to increase cardiac output only about 2 times during maximum rates of oxygen uptake. This ratio is not very different from those of other teleosts.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms play a critical role in fish development and daily activities. Although a major circadian "master" clock, like the SCN of mammals, has not yet been identified in fish, indirect evidence suggests that a light-entrainable oscillator is present in fish brain. Furthermore, the structural and functional design of fish circadian systems is remarkably complicated. Photosensitive CNS-related clock organs (the pineal gland and retina), peripheral photosensitive tissues with autonomic circadian clocks, and presumed food- or temperature-entrainable circadian oscillator(s) all make for complex circadian machinery that must remain well coordinated and still be able to ensure physiological adaptation to a periodically changing environment. Such a multilevel structure of partially independent oscillators may explain the high interspecies variability observed in piscine circadian systems and substantial individual plasticity in fish behaviour and physiology. Studying these features will continue to contribute to a better understanding of the principal mechanisms involved in circadian clock functions. Data accumulated so far show that rest in fish has fundamental similarities to the behavioural manifestations of sleep in higher vertebrates. Analogous to sleep in mammals, fish show a compensatory rest rebound, reducing locomotor activity and increasing arousal thresholds after a period of rest deprivation, suggesting that fish exert a homeostatic control on rest behaviour. Furthermore, rest in fish is regulated by the circadian system, because periodic reduction in locomotor activity and increase in arousal threshold are maintained in constant darkness and occur during the subjective night. These observations, together with the hypnotic effects of melatonin and sleep-inducing agents of the benzodiazepine and barbiturate families, indicate that rest behaviour in fish can be considered a sleeplike state. Studying sleep in fish may prove to be very productive in deciphering both the enigmatic function and the physiological mechanisms of sleep. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

These are the first recordings of blood flow from free-swimming fish, showing that the system is capable of recording blood flow in the ventral aorta (cardiac output) and celiacomesenteric artery (gastrointestinal blood flow) in green sturgeon Acipenser medirostris exposed to a series of different stimuli for up to 7 days after implantation. The results showed stable base line recordings and blood flow was used to calculated heart rate (f H) and stroke volume (V s). It was possible to reproduce the same type of responses as has previously been reported during exposure to hypoxia, temperature, stress and feeding. The mass of our implant was less than 2{\%} of the body mass which is well within the recommended sizes for surgically implanted telemetry transmitters and it fitted easily within the abdominal cavity of the sturgeon. A fully implantable system minimizes the risk of infection/expulsion and maximizes the likelihood that the studied fish will behave naturally and be treated normally by surrounding fish. The use of biotelemetry in basic comparative physiology and applied animal ecology could help scientists to collect information that has previously been challenging to obtain and to open the possibility for new types of physiological and ecophysiological studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, And ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {How coral reefs survive as oases of life in low-productivity oceans has puzzled scientists for centuries. The answer may lie in internal nutrient cycling and/or input from the pelagic zone. Integrating meta-analysis, field data, and population modeling, we show that the ocean's smallest vertebrates, cryptobenthic reef fishes, promote internal reef fish biomass production through extensive larval supply from the pelagic environment. Specifically, cryptobenthics account for two-thirds of reef fish larvae in the near-reef pelagic zone despite limited adult reproductive outputs. This overwhelming abundance of cryptobenthic larvae fuels reef trophodynamics via rapid growth and extreme mortality, producing almost 60{\%} of consumed reef fish biomass. Although cryptobenthics are often overlooked, their distinctive demographic dynamics may make them a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning on modern coral reefs.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics},

In all three species the mass-specific routine rate decreases exponentially after hatching. 3. Routine and maximum rates of oxygen con-sumption follow the same temperature relation-ship, with an indication of lowered temperature sensitivity between 16 and 20 {\~{}} as compared with the ranges 12-16 and 20-24 {\~{}} 4. The relative factorial scope for activity, i.e. the ratio Vo2 max/{\~{}} routine, ranges from 2.4 to 2.9 at the four experimental temperatures em-ployed, but none of the differences between tem-peratures are significant. Equally, within the weight range studied, the regression of scope on body weight is indistinguishable from zero at all four experimental temperatures. 5. It is argued that larval fish have escaped the constraints of small size on aerobic scope for activity, a typical feature of larger poikilotherms, by a combination of morphological, physiological and biochemical adaptations. 6. The development of the routine rate of oxy-gen consumption in cyprinids during larval life is compared with that in a coregonid and a salmonid species (Fig. 3).

Scientists that had published three or more papers on the effects of climate and environmental factors on reef fishes were invited to submit five questions that, if addressed, would improve our understanding of climate change effects on coral reef fishes. Thirty-three scientists provided 155 questions, and 32 scientists scored these questions in terms of: (i) identifying a knowledge gap, (ii) achievability, (iii) applicability to a broad spectrum of species and reef habitats, and (iv) priority. Forty-two per cent of the questions related to habitat associations and community dynamics of fish, reflecting the established effects and immediate concern relating to climate-induced coral loss and habitat degradation. However, there were also questions on fish demographics, physiology, behaviour and management, all of which could be potentially affected by climate change. Irrespective of their individual expertise and background, scientists scored questions from different topics similarly, suggesting limited bias and recognition of a need for greater interdisciplinary and collaborative research. Presented here are the 53 highest-scoring unique questions. These questions should act as a guide for future research, providing a basis for better assessment and management of climate change impacts on coral reefs and associated fish communities.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Body size has been identified as a key driver of home-range area. Despite considerable research into home-range allometry, the relatively high variability in this relationship among taxa means that the mechanisms driving this relationship are still under debate. To date, studies have predominantly focused on terrestrial taxa, and coral reef fishes in particular have received little attention. We quantitatively reviewed studies examining home range in reef fishes, and assessed the interspecific rela tionship between body mass and home-range area. Body mass and home range are positively related in reef fishes (slopes of 1.15–1.72), with predators having larger home ranges than herbivorous species. This may be attributed to the mobility and lower abundance of predators' food items. Coral reef fishes, and fishes in general, appear to occupy a smaller area per unit mass than terrestrial vertebrates (intercepts of −0.92 to 0.07 versus ≥1.14). This is likely linked to the relative metabolic costs of moving through water compared to air. The small home ranges of reef fishes and their apparent reluctance to cross open areas suggest that reserves aimed at protecting fish species may be more effective if located across whole reefs, even if those reefs are comparatively small, rather than if they cover subsections of contiguous reef, as home ranges in the former are less likely to cross reserve boundaries.},

abstract = {Consumption is the basis of metabolic and trophic ecology and is used to assess an animal's trophic impact. The contribution of activity to an animal's energy budget is an important parameter when estimating consumption, yet activity is usually measured in captive animals. Developments in telemetry have allowed the energetic costs of activity to be measured for wild animals; however, wild activity is seldom incorporated into estimates of consumption rates. We calculated the consumption rate of a free-ranging marine predator (yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi) by integrating the energetic cost of free-ranging activity into a bioenergetics model. Accelerometry transmitters were used in conjunction with laboratory respirometry trials to estimate kingfish active metabolic rate in the wild. These field-derived consumption rate estimates were compared with those estimated by two traditional bioenergetics methods. The first method derived routine swimming speed from fish morphology as an index of activity (a "morphometric" method), and the second considered activity as a fixed proportion of standard metabolic rate (a "physiological" method). The mean consumption rate for free-ranging kingfish measured by accelerometry was 152 J{\textperiodcentered}g-1{\textperiodcentered}day-1, which lay between the estimates from the morphometric method ($\mu$ = 134 J{\textperiodcentered}g-1{\textperiodcentered}day-1) and the physiological method ($\mu$ = 181 J{\textperiodcentered}g-1{\textperiodcentered}day-1). Incorporating field-derived activity values resulted in the smallest variance in log-normally distributed consumption rates ($\sigma$ = 0.31), compared with the morphometric ($\sigma$ = 0.57) and physiological ($\sigma$ = 0.78) methods. Incorporating field-derived activity into bioenergetics models probably provided more realistic estimates of consumption rate compared with the traditional methods, which may further our understanding of trophic interactions that underpin ecosystem-based fisheries management. The general methods used to estimate active metabolic rates of free-ranging fish could be extended to examine ecological energetics and trophic interactions across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.

abstract = {The field metabolic rates (FMRs) of 229 species of terrestrial vertebrates, all measured using the doubly labeled water method in free-living individuals, were evaluated. Daily rates of energy expenditure were as low as 0.23 kJ per day in a small reptile (gecko), to as high as 52 500 kJ per day in a marine mammal (seal). This is a range of nearly six orders of magnitude. More than 70{\%} of the variation in log-transformed data is due to variation in body size (expressed as body mass). Much of the remaining variation is accounted for by thermal physiology, with the endothermic mammals and birds having FMRs that are about 12 and 20 times higher, respectively, than FMRs of equivalent-sized, but ectothermic, reptiles. Variation in log(body mass) within each of these three taxonomic classes accounts for over 94{\%} of the variation in log(FMR), and results from nonlinear regression analyses using untransformed data support this conclusion. However, the range of residual variation in mass-adjusted FMR within classes is still more than sixfold (ratio of highest over lowest). Some of this variation is associated with affiliations with lower taxonomic levels (Infraclass: eutherian vs metatherian mammals; Family: passerine, procellariform and galliform birds vs other birds), some is associated with habitat (especially desert vs nondesert), and some with differences in basic diet preference and foraging mode and season. The scaling slopes for FMR often differ from BMR slopes for the same Class of animals, and most differ from the theoretical slope of 0.75. Differences among slopes and intercepts that were detected using conventional regression analyses were largely confirmed upon reanalysis using Independent Contrasts Analysis to adjust for phylogenetic biases.},

Previous studies on fish have found SMR to closely correlate with dominance and position in the social hierarchy, and to be highly repeatable over time when fish were provided an ad libitum diet. In this study we tested the temporal repeatability of individual SMR, AMR and AAS, as well as repeatability of body mass, in young brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) fed a moderately restricted diet (0.5-0.7{\%} fish mass day⁻¹). Metabolism was estimated from measurements of oxygen consumption rate (M(.)(O₂)) and repeatability was evaluated four times across a 15-week period. Individual body mass was highly repeatable across the entire 15 week experimental period whereas residual body-mass-corrected SMR, AMR and AAS showed a gradual loss of repeatability over time. Individual residual SMR, AMR and AAS were significantly repeatable in the short term (5 weeks), gradually declined across the medium term (10 weeks) and completely disappeared in the long term (15 weeks). We suggest that this gradual decline in repeatability was due to the slightly restricted feeding regime. This is discussed in the context of phenotypic plasticity, natural selection and ecology.},

To address these issues, studies have been increasingly focusing on functions of fish that are linked to their main ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are indeed known to control other organisms through predation, mediate nutrient fluxes, and can act as ecosystem engineers. Here for each of the key functions played by fish, we present the functional traits that have already been used to assess them. We include traits measurable from observations on living individuals, morphological features measured on preserved organisms or traits categorized using information from the literature, and we discuss their respective advantages and limitations. We then list future research directions to foster a more complete functional approach for fish ecology that needs to incorporate functional traits describing, food provisioning and cultural services while accounting more frequently for intraspecific variability. Finally, we highlight ecological and evolutionary questions that could be addressed using meta-analyses of large trait databases, and how a trait-based framework could provide valuable insights on the mechanistic links between global changes, functional diversity of fish assemblages, and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Coral reefs harbor high productivity in nutrient-poor tropical oceans. This exceptional productivity can be explained by high recycling rates [1, 2], deep-water nutrient enrichment [3], and assimilation of external production [4]. Fishes consume this productivity through multiple trophic pathways and, as a result, dominate consumer biomass. Their reliance on pelagic versus benthic productivity pathways has been quantified from the tissues of individual fish [5, 6], but the contribution of different energetic pathways to the total productivity of coral reef fish assemblages remains unquantified. Here, we combined high-resolution surveys and individual biomass production estimates to generate the first energetic map of a full coral reef fish assemblage, from the smallest to the largest fishes [7, 8]. We found that the windward section of a coral reef on the Great Barrier Reef delivered an average fish productivity of 4.7 kg ha −1 day −1 , of which 41{\%} was derived from water column photosynthesis, 29{\%} by the epibenthic reef surface, 14{\%} from cryptobenthic microhabitats, and 11{\%} from adjacent sandy areas. The critical energetic contribution of pelagic subsidies would remain undetected if considering fish standing biomass alone, because the high productivity of reef planktivores originated from a relatively small biomass. Importantly, this study took place on a reef with only ∼6{\%} of coral cover following multiple coral mortality events. Thus, our study offers hope that reefs subject to coral loss can still maintain considerable fish productivity, with planktivorous fishes providing major pelagic subsidies. Morais and Bellwood document major pelagic subsidies to fishes on a windward low-coral reef. Pelagic subsidies increase toward forereef zones, drive total fish production, and are mediated by topographic complexity. Internal fish production does not track complexity. Pelagic subsidies may be maintained after coral loss if complexity is retained.},

abstract = {Evidence is building to suggest that both chronic and acute warm temperature exposure, as well as other anthropogenic perturbations, may select for small adult fish within a species. To shed light on this phenomenon, we investigated physiological and anatomical attributes associated with size-specific responses to an acute thermal challenge and a fisheries capture simulation (exercise+air exposure) in maturing male coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Full-size females were included for a sex-specific comparison. A size-specific response in haematology to an acute thermal challenge (from 7 to 20 degrees C at 3 degrees C h(-1)) was apparent only for plasma potassium, whereby full-size males exhibited a significant increase in comparison with smaller males ('jacks'). Full-size females exhibited an elevated blood stress response in comparison with full-size males. Metabolic recovery following exhaustive exercise at 7 degrees C was size-specific, with jacks regaining resting levels of metabolism at 9.3 +/- 0.5 h post-exercise in comparison with 12.3 +/- 0.4 h for full-size fish of both sexes. Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption scaled with body mass in male fish with an exponent of b = 1.20 +/- 0.08. Jacks appeared to regain osmoregulatory homeostasis faster than full-size males, and they had higher ventilation rates at 1 h post-exercise. Peak metabolic rate during post-exercise recovery scaled with body mass with an exponent of b{\~{}}1, suggesting that the slower metabolic recovery in large fish was not due to limitations in diffusive or convective oxygen transport, but that large fish simply accumulated a greater 'oxygen debt' that took longer to pay back at the size-independent peak metabolic rate of {\~{}}6 mg min(-1) kg(-1). Post-exercise recovery of plasma testosterone was faster in jacks compared with full-size males, suggesting less impairment of the maturation trajectory of smaller fish. Supporting previous studies, these findings suggest that environmental change and non-lethal fisheries interactions have the potential to select for small individuals within fish populations over time.},

Characteristic among all of these species is a rapid postprandial increase in metabolic rate that upon peaking returns more slowly to prefeeding levels. The average maximum increase in metabolic rate stemming from digestion ranges from a modest 25{\%} for humans to 136{\%} for fishes, and to an impressive 687{\%} for snakes. The type, size, composition, and temperature of the meal, as well as body size, body composition, and several environmental factors (e.g., ambient temperature and gas concentration) can each significantly impact the magnitude and duration of the SDA response. Meals that are large, intact or possess a tough exoskeleton require more digestive effort and thus generate a larger SDA than small, fragmented, or soft-bodied meals. Differences in the individual effort of preabsorptive (e.g., swallowing, gastric breakdown, and intestinal transport) and postabsorptive (e.g., catabolism and synthesis) events underlie much of the variation in SDA. Specific dynamic action is an integral part of an organism's energy budget, exemplified by accounting for 19-43{\%} of the daily energy expenditure of free-ranging snakes. There are innumerable opportunities for research in SDA including coverage of unexplored taxa, investigating the underlying sources, determinants, and the central control of postprandial metabolism, and examining the integration of SDA across other physiological systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The power-law dependence of metabolic rate on body mass has major implications at every level of ecological organization. However, the overwhelming majority of studies examining this relationship have used basal or resting metabolic rates, and/or have used data consisting of species-averaged masses and metabolic rates. Field metabolic rates are more ecologically relevant and are probably more directly subject to natural selection than basal rates. Individual rates might be more important than species-average rates in determining the outcome of ecological interactions, and hence selection. We here provide the first comprehensive database of published field metabolic rates and body masses of individual birds and mammals, containing measurements of 1498 animals of 133 species in 28 orders. We used linear mixed-effects models to answer questions about the body mass scaling of metabolic rate and its taxonomic universality/heterogeneity that have become classic areas of controversy. Our statistical approach allows mean scaling exponents and taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling to be analysed in a unified way while simultaneously accounting for nonindependence in the data due to shared evolutionary history of related species. The mean power-law scaling exponents of metabolic rate vs. body mass relationships were 0{\textperiodcentered}71 [95{\%} confidence intervals (CI) 0{\textperiodcentered}625-0{\textperiodcentered}795] for birds and 0{\textperiodcentered}64 (95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}564-0{\textperiodcentered}716) for mammals. However, these central tendencies obscured meaningful taxonomic heterogeneity in scaling exponents. The primary taxonomic level at which heterogeneity occurred was the order level. Substantial heterogeneity also occurred at the species level, a fact that cannot be revealed by species-averaged data sets used in prior work. Variability in scaling exponents at both order and species levels was comparable to or exceeded the differences 3/4-2/3 = 1/12 and 0{\textperiodcentered}71-0{\textperiodcentered}64. Results are interpreted in the light of a variety of existing theories. In particular, results are consistent with the heat dissipation theory of Speakman {\&} Kr{\'{o}}l (2010) and provided some support for the metabolic levels boundary hypothesis of Glazier (2010). Our analysis provides the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the scaling relationship between field metabolic rate and body mass in individual birds and mammals. Our data set is a valuable contribution to those interested in theories of the allometry of metabolic rates.},

abstract = {The extent of the global human footprint [1] limits our understanding of what is natural in the marine environment. Remote, near-pristine areas provide some baseline expectations for biomass [2, 3] and suggest that predators dominate, producing an inverted biomass pyramid. The southern pass of Fakarava atoll—a biosphere reserve in French Polynesia—hosts an average of 600 reef sharks, two to three times the biomass per hectare documented for any other reef shark aggregations [4]. This huge biomass of predators makes the trophic pyramid inverted. Bioenergetics models indicate that the sharks require ∼90 tons of fish per year, whereas the total fish production in the pass is ∼17 tons per year. Energetic theory shows that such trophic structure is maintained through subsidies [5–9], and empirical evidence suggests that sharks must engage in wide-ranging foraging excursions to meet energy needs [9, 10]. We used underwater surveys and acoustic telemetry to assess shark residency in the pass and feeding behavior and used bioenergetics models to understand energy flow. Contrary to previous findings, our results highlight that sharks may overcome low local energy availability by feeding on fish spawning aggregations, which concentrate energy from other local trophic pyramids. Fish spawning aggregations are known to be targeted by sharks, but they were previously believed to play a minor role representing occasional opportunistic supplements. This research demonstrates that fish spawning aggregations can play a significant role in the maintenance of local inverted pyramids in pristine marine areas. Conservation of fish spawning aggregations can help conserve shark populations, especially if combined with shark fishing bans.},

Using data for 131 teleost fish species, we performed a large-scale phylogenetic comparative analysis of how interspecific variation in resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and maximum metabolic rates (MMRs) is related to several ecological and morphological variables. Mass- and temperature-adjusted RMR and MMR are highly correlated along a continuum spanning a 30- to 40-fold range. Phylogenetic generalized least squares models suggest that RMR and MMR are higher in pelagic species and that species with higher trophic levels exhibit elevated MMR. This variation is mirrored at various levels of structural organization: gill surface area, muscle protein content, and caudal fin aspect ratio (a proxy for activity) are positively related with aerobic capacity.

Typically, the relationship is expressed as an allometric equation of the form BMR = aM(b). The scaling exponent (b) is a point of contention throughout this body of literature, within which arguments for and against geometric (b = 2/3) and quarter-power (b = 3/4) scaling are made and rebutted. Recently, interest in the topic has been revived by published explanations for quarter-power scaling based on fractal nutrient supply networks and four-dimensional biology. Here, a new analysis of the allometry of mammalian BMR that accounts for variation associated with body temperature, digestive state, and phylogeny finds no support for a metabolic scaling exponent of 3/4.

abstract = {Metabolic costs are central to individual energy budgets, making estimates of metabolic rate vital to understanding how an organism interacts with its environment as well as the role of species in their ecosystem. Despite the ecological and commercial importance of fishes, there are currently no widely adopted means of measuring field metabolic rate in fishes. The lack of recognized methods is in part due to the logistical difficulties of measuring metabolic rates in free swimming fishes. However, further development and refinement of techniques applicable for field-based studies on free swimming animals would greatly enhance the capacity to study fish under environmentally relevant conditions. In an effort to foster discussion in this area, from field ecologists to biochemists alike, we review aspects of energy metabolism and give details on approaches that have been used to estimate energetic parameters in fishes. In some cases, the techniques have been applied to field conditions; while in others, the methods have been primarily used on laboratory held fishes but should be applicable, with validation, to fishes in their natural environment. Limitations, experimental considerations and caveats of these measurements and the study of metabolism in wild fishes in general are also discussed. Potential novel approaches to FMR estimates are also presented for consideration. The innovation of methods for measuring field metabolic rate in free-ranging wild fish would revolutionize the study of physiological ecology.},

abstract = {Metabolic rates of aquatic organisms are estimated from measurements of oxygen consumption rates ( ) through swimming and resting respirometry. These distinct approaches are increasingly used in ecophysiology and conservation physiology studies; however, few studies have tested whether they yield comparable results. We examined whether two fundamental measures, standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR), vary based on the method employed. Ten bridled monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineata) were exercised using (1) a critical swimming speed (Ucrit) protocol, (2) a 15 min exhaustive chase protocol and (3) a 3 min exhaustive chase protocol followed by brief (1 min) air exposure. Protocol 1 was performed in a swimming respirometer whereas protocols 2 and 3 were followed by resting respirometry. SMR estimates in swimming respirometry were similar to those in resting respirometry when a three-parameter exponential or power function was used to extrapolate the swimming speed- relationship to zero swimming speed. In contrast, MMR using the Ucrit protocol was 36{\%} higher than MMR derived from the 15 min chase protocol and 23{\%} higher than MMR using the 3 min chase/1 min air exposure protocol. For strong steady (endurance) swimmers, such as S. bilineata, swimming respirometry can produce more accurate MMR estimates than exhaustive chase protocols because oxygen consumption is measured during exertion. However, when swimming respirometry is impractical, exhaustive chase protocols should be supplemented with brief air exposure to improve measurement accuracy. Caution is warranted when comparing MMR estimates obtained with different respirometry methods unless they are cross-validated on a species-specific basis.},

abstract = {To determine the energetic costs of rigid-body, median or paired-fin (MPF) swimming versus undulatory, body-caudal fin (BCF) swimming, we measured oxygen consumption as a function of swimming speed in two MPF swimming specialists, Schlegel's parrotfish and Picasso triggerfish. The parrotfish swam exclusively with the pectoral fins at prolonged swimming speeds up to 3.2 total lengths per second (L s(-1); 30 min critical swimming speed, U(crit)). At higher speeds, gait transferred to a burst-and-coast BCF swimming mode that resulted in rapid fatigue. The triggerfish swam using undulations of the soft dorsal and anal fins up to 1.5 L s(-1), beyond which BCF undulations were recruited intermittently. BCF swimming was used continuously above 3.5 L s(-1), and was accompanied by synchronous undulations of the dorsal and anal fins. The triggerfish were capable of high, prolonged swimming speeds of up to 4.1 L s(-1) (30 min U(crit)). In both species, the rates of increase in oxygen consumption with swimming speed were higher during BCF swimming than during rigid-body MPF swimming. Our results indicate that, for these species, undulatory swimming is energetically more costly than rigid-body swimming, and therefore support the hypothesis that MPF swimming is more efficient. In addition, use of the BCF gait at higher swimming speed increased the cost of transport in both species beyond that predicted for MPF swimming at the same speeds. This suggests that, unlike for terrestrial locomotion, gait transition in fishes does not occur to reduce energetic costs, but to increase recruitable muscle mass and propulsive surfaces. The appropriate use of the power and exponential functions to model swimming energetics is also discussed.},

abstract = {Corals thrive in low nutrient environments and the conservation of these globally imperiled ecosystems is largely dependent on mitigating the effects of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment. However, to better understand the implications of anthropogenic nutrients requires a heightened understanding of baseline nutrient dynamics within these ecosystems. Here, we provide a novel perspective on coral reef nutrient dynamics by examining the role of fish communities in the supply and storage of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). We quantified fish-mediated nutrient storage and supply for 144 species and modeled these data onto 172 fish communities (71 729 individual fish), in four types of coral reefs, as well as seagrass and mangrove ecosystems, throughout the Northern Antilles. Fish communities supplied and stored large quantities of nutrients, with rates varying among ecosystem types. The size structure and diversity of the fish communities best predicted N and P supply and storage and N : P supply, suggesting that alterations to fish communities (e.g., overfishing) will have important implications for nutrient dynamics in these systems. The stoichiometric ratio (N : P) for storage in fish mass ({\~{}}8 : 1) and supply ({\~{}}20 : 1) was notably consistent across the four coral reef types (but not seagrass or mangrove ecosystems). Published nutrient enrichment studies on corals show that deviations from this N : P supply ratio may be associated with poor coral fitness, providing qualitative support for the hypothesis that corals and their symbionts may be adapted to specific ratios of nutrient supply. Consumer nutrient stoichiometry provides a baseline from which to better understand nutrient dynamics in coral reef and other coastal ecosystems, information that is greatly needed if we are to implement more effective measures to ensure the future health of the world's oceans.},

The ability to predict feeding rates of terrestrial vertebrates should be useful to zoo keepers, animal nutritionists, veterinarians, pet hobbyists, wildlife zoologists, game managers, range biologists, preserve directors and planners, conservationists, paleontologists and ecosystem modelers. These equations should underestimate somewhat the feeding rates of free-living animals that are growing, reproducing or storing up fat.

abstract = {One of the most important events in vertebrate evolution was the acquisition of endothermy, the ability to use metabolic heat production to elevate body temperature above environmental temperature. Several verbal models have been proposed to explain the selective factors leading to the evolution of endothermy. Of these, the aerobic capacity model has received the most attention in recent years. The aerobic capacity model postulates that selection acted mainly to increase maximal aerobic capacity (or associated behavioral abilities) and that elevated resting met- abolic rate evolved as a correlated response. Here we evaluate the implicit evolutionary and genetic assumptions of the aerobic capacity model. In light of this evaluation, we assess the utility of phenotypic and genetic correlations for testing the aerobic capacity model. Collectively, the available intraspecific data for terrestrial vertebrates support the notion of a positive phenotypic correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption within species. Interspecific analyses provide mixed support for this phenotypic correlation. We argue, however, that as- sessments of phenotypic or genetic correlations within species and evolutionary correlations among species (from comparative data) are of limited utility, because they may not be able to distinguish between the aerobic capacity model and plausible alternatives, such as selection acting directly on aspects of thermoregulatory abilities. We suggest six sources of information that may help shed light on the selective factors important during the evolution of high aerobic metabolic rates and, ultimately, the attainment of endothermy. Of particular interest will be attempts to determine, using a combination of mechanistic physiological and quantitative-genetic approaches, whether a positive genetic correlation between resting and maximal rates of oxygen consumption is an ineluctable feature of vertebrate physiology},

abstract = {We tested the utility of acoustic tri-axial acceleration transmitters in combination with ethogram and respirometry studies to quantify the activity patterns and field metabolic rates of free-swimming bonefish (Albula vulpes) in the coastal waters of Eleuthera, The Bahamas. Bonefish were found to exhibit relatively low activity levels in the field with no evidence of diel patterns or inter-sexual variation. Low activity levels reported by the accelerometers reflected low swimming speeds and intermittent swimming behaviours (i.e., swim-then-drift) that maximized energy efficiency. Such behaviours were also observed when conducting ethograms on bonefish held in a large field mesocosm. Laboratory derived standard metabolic rates and maximum metabolic rates during recovery from exercise were combined with acceleration transmitter calibrations to determine that individual bonefish typically operate at between 40 and 60{\%} of their estimated metabolic scope in the field. However, occasionally acceleration values in the field were indicative of high intensity bursting activity that exhausted the majority of their estimated metabolic scope (0.7{\%} of all field observations exceed 90{\%} of estimated metabolic scope). Data gathered in this study provide a critical starting point for the development of a bioenergetics model for bonefish which will ultimately lend clues into how fish make a living in tropical tidal flats environments. Given that this paper is one of the first to use transmitters rather than archival loggers to collect data on tri-axial acceleration on fish, we also discuss the opportunities and limitations of using this new technology for marine fisheries research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The first technique uses two or more video cameras to track a single point in 3-D. This method is more general, simpler, more flexible, and more precise than the widely used stereo method. Its use of a 3-D calibration quadrat frees the investigator to arrange cameras and adjust zoom lenses as he or she pleases, in contrast with the rather stringent requirements of the stereo method. It also allows a simple one-step rectification of all sources of systematic errosrs such as perspective effects, refraction at the air-water interface, and spherical distortion by the lens. the second technique expands the first to allow tracking of the fish's midline in 3-D. This simplifies tracking of the fish's center of mass and should facilitate the application of models that describe how swimming thrust is produced by a fish's body movements. The third technique allows estimation of swimming speed for fish foraging in flowing water, where there is significant velocity shear, permitting more accurate estimates of energy expenditure.},

abstract = {Ectoparasites can reduce individual fitness by negatively affecting behavioural, morphological and physiological traits. In fishes, there are potential costs if ectoparasites decrease streamlining, thereby directly compromising swimming performance. Few studies have examined the effects of ectoparasites on fish swimming performance and none distinguish between energetic costs imposed by changes in streamlining and effects on host physiology. The bridled monocle bream (Scolopsis bilineatus) is parasitized by an isopod (Anilocra nemipteri), which attaches above the eye. We show that parasitized fish have higher standard metabolic rates (SMRs), poorer aerobic capacities and lower maximum swimming speeds than non-parasitized fish. Adding a model parasite did not affect SMR, but reduced maximum swimming speed and elevated oxygen consumption rates at high speeds to levels observed in naturally parasitized fish. This demonstrates that ectoparasites create drag effects that are important at high speeds. The higher SMR of naturally parasitized fish does, however, reveal an effect of parasitism on host physiology. This effect was easily reversed: fish whose parasite was removed 24 h earlier did not differ from unparasitized fish in any performance metrics. In sum, the main cost of this ectoparasite is probably its direct effect on streamlining, reducing swimming performance at high speeds.},

@article{Motulsky2006,
abstract = {Background: Nonlinear regression, like linear regression, assumes that the scatter of data around the ideal curve follows a Gaussian or normal distribution. This assumption leads to the familiar goal of regression: to minimize the sum of the squares of the vertical or Y-value distances between the points and the curve. Outliers can dominate the sum-of-the-squares calculation, and lead to misleading results. However, we know of no practical method for routinely identifying outliers when fitting curves with nonlinear regression. Results: We describe a new method for identifying outliers when fitting data with nonlinear regression. We first fit the data using a robust form of nonlinear regression, based on the assumption that scatter follows a Lorentzian distribution. We devised a new adaptive method that gradually becomes more robust as the method proceeds. To define outliers, we adapted the false discovery rate approach to handling multiple comparisons. We then remove the outliers, and analyze the data using ordinary least-squares regression. Because the method combines robust regression and outlier removal, we call it the ROUT method. When analyzing simulated data, where all scatter is Gaussian, our method detects (falsely) one or more outlier in only about 1-3{\%} of experiments. When analyzing data contaminated with one or several outliers, the ROUT method performs well at outlier identification, with an average False Discovery Rate less than 1{\%}. Conclusion: Our method, which combines a new method of robust nonlinear regression with a new method of outlier identification, identifies outliers from nonlinear curve fits with reasonable power and few false positives. {\textcopyright} 2006 Motulsky and Brown; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Cutts2002,
abstract = {1. There is an established relationship between metabolism and behavioural dominance in several fish species, such that individuals with higher standard metabolic rates tend to be more dominant. It has also been suggested that metabolic scope increases with standard metabolic rate. 2. Energetically expensive behaviours attributable to dominance, such as aggression, can be carried out to a greater extent within larger metabolic scopes. This study therefore tests the hypothesis that juvenile salmon with higher standard metabolic rates (which tend to be dominant) have larger metabolic scopes. 3. It was found that salmon with high standard metabolic rates (corrected for body mass) in fact had smaller metabolic scopes than conspecifics with relatively low standard metabolic rates. Possible reasons for their potential dominance while having small metabolic scopes and high relative standard metabolic rates are discussed.},

abstract = {Intermittent-flow respirometry is an experimental protocol for measuring oxygen consumption in aquatic organisms that utilizes the best features of closed (stop-flow) and flow-through respirometry while eliminating (or at least reducing) some of their inherent problems. By interspersing short periods of closed-chamber oxygen consumption measurements with regular flush periods, accurate oxygen uptake rate measurements can be made without the accumulation of waste products, particularly carbon dioxide, which may confound results. Automating the procedure with easily available hardware and software further reduces error by allowing many measurements to be made over long periods thereby minimizing animal stress due to acclimation issues. This paper describes some of the fundamental principles that need to be considered when designing and carrying out automated intermittent-flow respirometry (e.g. chamber size, flush rate, flush time, chamber mixing, measurement periods and temperature control). Finally, recent advances in oxygen probe technology and open source automation software will be discussed in the context of assembling relatively low cost and reliable measurement systems.},
